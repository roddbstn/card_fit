# Service Planning & PRD

## 1. Project Context
- **Current State**: App-based Fintech Service.
- **Stage**: Hypothesis Validation & Data Collection.

## 2. Problem Definition & Evolution
### Initial Hypothesis
- **Problem**: "People cannot receive card benefits properly because they are too complicated."
- **Analysis**: Card companies design benefits to be complex intentionally. Users may find it "too annoying" to think deeply about this, suggesting they might not feel it is a critical pain point.

### Redefined Problem
- **New Perspective**: "Consuming without knowing if I am using my benefits effectively."
- **Dilemma**: Does the user have a need to "be informed" (Efficiency), or is the desire to "spend freely without worry" (Freedom) stronger?
- **Key Question**: "Is this a problem users actually want solved?"

## 3. Objective
- **Goal**: Secure data to confirm if the "Redefined Problem" is a genuine pain point for users.
- **Method**: Minimize development time by creating a simple "Smoke Test" landing page to gauge interest.

## 4. Validation Experiment
### Landing Page Requirements
- **Purpose**: Introduce the value proposition and collect email addresses of interested users.
- **Design Philosophy**:
    - **Reference**: Toss (Korean Fintech Unicorn).
    - **Style**: Minimalist, High Impact, Premium.
    - **Key Elements**:
        - Strong Value Proposition Headline.
        - Simple visual/device mockup.
        - Email input field + "Join/Notify" button.
- **Target Metric**: Conversion rate (Email submissions).

## 5. Development Plan
- **Platform**: Web (HTML/CSS/JS).
- **Location**: `/validation_landing_page` directory.
